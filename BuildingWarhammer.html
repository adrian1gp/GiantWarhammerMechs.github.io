    <p>
Warhammer models come unassembled and need to be assembled using plastic nippers and glue. When you first open the kit you'll usually see some sprues, decals, instructions, and plastic bases to put your models on. When reading the instructions, make sure you read them carefully so as to not accidentally ruin one of your figures. The instructions will tell you what part numbers to cut out of the sprue and how to assemble them.

When assembling your minis, make sure you don't cut too close to the gates of a part (the gates are the pieces of plastic connecting the part to the sprue). If you cut too close to it you'll end up cracking the plastic and you do not want this to happen. Once this is done, you'll want to remove any mold lines on the model. These are extra lines on some pieces of the minis that happen due to the way Warhammer models are made. You can remove them using a hobby or pocket knife, or by using some fine grit sand paper.

Once finished smoothing and cleaning your models, you can start assembling them. You'll want to use plastic cement for most of the pieces, however the smaller ones should be put on using super glue. This will make the process easier and cause mistakes to happen less often. Hold the parts that you've just glued together for about 20 seconds and then glue the next part on.
