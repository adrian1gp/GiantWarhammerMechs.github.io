    <h2>Why I love painting and building warhammer models</h1>
<div class="StanderedPharograph">
    <p>
        To me, painting is extremely relaxing and fun as well as productive. You get to spend hours perfecting your model and when you're done it looks amazing. The amount of customization and paints you can use also contributes to my love for the hobby. Painting with metallics is also a guilty pleasure of mind because they give models that extra layer of "Awsomeness."

In addition to this, the amount of detail of warhammer models is awesome. The models look almost as if they were pulled from real life. It's also somewhat easy for you to customize your models if you have extra pieces. The building experience	is also one of my favorite parts of building models because seeing how everything gets put together and forms a complete model.
